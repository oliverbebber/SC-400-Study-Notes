## Implement Microsoft Purview Message Encryption

After implementing the org's tenant encryption method, Microsoft Purview Message Encryption (PME) can be implemented.

**Note:** The following steps require a connection to the Exchange Online PowerShell module and Exchange admin permissions to make the changes to the tenant.

1. Validate IRM configuration of the tenant using the following command:

```ps
Get-IRMConfiguration | fl AzureRMSLicensingEnabled
```

2. If AzureRMSLicensingEnabled is set to `$False`, active OME for the tenant using the following command:

```ps
Set-IRMConfiguration -AzureRMSLicensingEnabled:$True
```

3. Check if IRM data can be obtained for an external recipient using the following command:

```ps
Test-IRMConfiguration -Sender admin@companyname.com -Recipient someuser@somecompany.com
```

4. The output will display results from several tests, as well as an overall test result. These should show as PASS.
